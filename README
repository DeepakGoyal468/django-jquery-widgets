jquery_widgets folder into your django project.

Git::

  $ git clone git://github.com/smyrman/django-jquery-widgets.git



Project configuration
=====================

Quick guide
-----------

1 Add 'jquery_widgets' to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS

2 Add This line to your urlconf::

   url(r'^jqw/', include('jquery_widgets.urls', namespace='jquery-widgets')),

Note that you are free to call the url something else then 'jqw'.

3 The current version workes well with Django 1.3's staticfiles app. That means
  you can symlink or copy the static media into your STATIC_ROOT (needed for
  production only), by issuing::

   $ python manage.py [-l] collectstatic

Note that you need to have 'django.contrib.staticfiles' in your INSTALLED_APPS
for the above command to work. If you wan't to use this version of
django-jquery-widgets with an older version of Django then 1.3, you have to
manually copy the files from 'jqury_widgets/static' into your MEDIA_ROOT
folder.
