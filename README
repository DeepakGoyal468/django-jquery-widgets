NOTE: This django-app wass created to make it easier for myself to include
extra functionallety in some of my django projects. It contains a very small
set of widgets (currently only one), and what widgets are included in the
future are currently only determined by my own personal needs. Do not hesitate
to come with suggestions though.


Installation:
  Using pip:
  - pip -e git://github.com/smyrman/django-jquery-widgets.git

  Usin pip and virtualenv:
  - pip -E path/to/env -e git://github.com/smyrman/django-jquery-widgets.git

  The normal download and '$ python setup.py install' procedure will also work.

  Then, in your django project:
    - add 'jquery_widgets' to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS
    - run 'python manage.py syncdb'. If you use a Unix flavoured OS, this will
      create a symlink to '<path>/jquery_widgets/media', in your MEDIA_ROOT.
      The symlink will be named: 'jquery_widgets'.
    - jQuery is included with django's contrib.admin app since Django version
      1.2. If you use a version of Django older them 1.2 (or if you do not use
      the django admin), make sure a recent version of jQury is available in
      your MEDIA_ROOT as 'js/jquery.min.js' Alternativly, you can configure
      JQUERY_URL in your settings.


Included widgets:
  ForeignKeySearchInput - An ajax auto-complete widget that replaces
    the normal select input.

Included for the admin:
  ExtendedModelAdmin - An extension of django.admin.ModelAdin that make it easy
    to use the included widgets in the admin view.
